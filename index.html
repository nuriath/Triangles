    <h1>TRIANGLE TRACKER</h1>

    <p>A plane figure with three straight sides and three angles.</p>

    <hr><h2><strong>Triangle Equilateral</strong></h2>
    <p>Equilatearal Triangle:In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
       In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all 
       three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.</p>
    <hr><h2><strong>Scalene Triangle</strong></h2>
    <p>A scalene triangle, one in which all sides (and therefore angles) are different</p>
    <hr><h2><strong>Isocele Triangle</strong></h2>
    <p>An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.[note 1][2] An isosceles triangle also 
       has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the two sides of the same
       length; this fact is the content of the isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid.</p>
